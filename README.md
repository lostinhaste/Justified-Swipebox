# Justified Swipebox - Hugo Plugin for Micro.blog üéûÔ∏è
Inspired by [GLightbox](https://github.com/jsonbecker/plugin-glightbox), a lovely image Hugo plugin created by [@jsonbecker](https://micro.blog/jsonbecker), Justified Swipebox is a plugin for [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) to _easily_ allow the creation of "clickable" image galleries on posts and pages. It depends on the [Justified Gallery](https://github.com/miromannino/Justified-Gallery) to create the initial gallery on the post/page and [Swipebox](https://github.com/brutaldesign/swipebox) to show the image(s) at a larger resolution when an item in the gallery is clicked / touched. This plugin wouldn't exist without either of those projects. üëèüèª

## How To Use
The plugin supplies two shortcodes, one for each image and one to call the required JavaScript (`justified-swipebox-entry` and `justified-swipebox-gallery`); essentially it's one to many `justified-swipebox-entry` shortcodes and `justified-swipebox-gallery` (per gallery).

The following code...
```go
<div id="gardenGlow2023" class="justified-gallery">
   {{< justified-swipebox-entry photo="https://lostinhaste.com/uploads/2023/garden-glow-01-full.jpg" >}}
   {{< justified-swipebox-entry photo="https://lostinhaste.com/uploads/2023/garden-glow-02-full.jpg" >}}
   {{< justified-swipebox-entry photo="https://lostinhaste.com/uploads/2023/garden-glow-03-full.jpg" >}}
   {{< justified-swipebox-entry photo="https://lostinhaste.com/uploads/2023/garden-glow-04-full.jpg" >}}
<div>

{{< justified-swipebox-gallery id="gardenGlow2023" rowHeight="200" >}}
```
...will result in something like this (depending on the template / theme you're using):

![Example 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lostinhaste/Justified-Swipebox/main/documentation/example-1.png)

Each gallery should be wrapped in a `div` with a class of _"justified-gallery"_. Multiple galleries are possible per page but the _id_ of the holding `div` needs to match the _gallery_ for each `justified-swipebox-entry` shortcode along with the the _id_ `justified-swipebox-gallery` shortcode.
